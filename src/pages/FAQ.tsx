    question: "What is an SSL Certificate?",
    answer: "An SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate is a digital certificate that authenticates a website's identity and enables an encrypted connection. It's essential for securing data transfer between a user's browser and the website server."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do I need an SSL Certificate?",
    answer: "SSL certificates are crucial for website security. They encrypt data transmission, protect user information, build trust with visitors, and improve your website's SEO ranking. Modern browsers also mark non-HTTPS sites as 'not secure'."
  },
  {
    question: "How does InstaCert's free SSL certificate work?",
    answer: "InstaCert generates free SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt's infrastructure. Simply enter your domain name, and we'll generate a valid SSL certificate instantly. No registration or payment required."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the SSL certificate really free?",
    answer: "Yes, our SSL certificates are completely free. We don't charge any fees, and there are no hidden costs or premium features. We believe in making website security accessible to everyone."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to generate a certificate?",
    answer: "Certificate generation is instant. Once you enter your domain name, you'll receive your SSL certificate within seconds. No waiting periods or complex procedures."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you store any of my data?",
    answer: "No, we don't store any of your data. Your information is only used during the certificate generation process and is not saved on our servers. We prioritize your privacy and security."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I install the SSL certificate?",
    answer: "After generating your certificate, you'll receive detailed installation instructions. The process varies depending on your hosting provider and server setup, but we provide clear guidance for common platforms."
  },
  {
    question: "What is Let's Encrypt?",
    answer: "Let's Encrypt is a non-profit certificate authority that provides free SSL certificates. It's trusted by major browsers and is the standard for free SSL certificates. InstaCert uses Let's Encrypt's infrastructure to generate certificates."
  },
  {
    question: "How long is the certificate valid?",
    answer: "Our SSL certificates are valid for 90 days, which is the standard validity period for Let's Encrypt certificates. You can easily generate a new certificate before expiration."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer support for certificate installation?",
    answer: "While we don't provide direct installation support, we offer comprehensive documentation and guides to help you install your SSL certificate. Our FAQ and help resources cover most common installation scenarios."
